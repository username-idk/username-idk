I need free money because I'm homeless and living next to a fast food restaurant

I lie a lot

Maybe that was a lie

It was not.

I am not homeless, I am actually the American god of books, pineapples, mountains, bicycles, forests, computers, trains, languages, pencils, hats, coins and cheesburgers.

I can make all cheeseburgers expolode with a snap of my fingers

Don't test me

I suck at tests

One time I took those "What Harry Potter character are you?" tests and I got a 63 out of 100.

I failed
